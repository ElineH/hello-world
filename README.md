# hello-world
My first GitHub repo

Hi, my name is Eline. I work as a software tester.
I'm currently learning test automation, mainly Playwright.
I'm also taking a JavaScript course on the side, and I'm
basically interested in anything that can make me a better
tester. My goal is to one day have the skills to call myself
a test developer or technical tester.
